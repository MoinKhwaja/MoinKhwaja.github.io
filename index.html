        <p>i hope this message finds you well, i am currently in the deep forests of south america, unknowing of my location</p>
        <p>there is much to tell of my tales here but for now i will start from when i encountered the village</p>
        <br>
        <p>so there i was, swimming in the great amazon river</p>
        <p>i had heard dangers of the forest, but they did not scare me at the time. the water felt good. it penetrated my skin and cooled my bones</p>
        <p>where i was headed i wasnt too sure of myself but the thoughts kept with me</p>
        <p>the thoughts of meeting them</p>
        <br>
        <p>deep within the forest there is a village</p>
        <p>a village of people who had never encountered the outside world</p>
